# Boardgame Collection

A system for managing a board game collection.

This repository contains a **single frontend** (`client-app`) and **two different backend implementations**:
- branch **dotnet** → backend in .NET  
- branch **nest** → backend in NestJS  

Both branches share the same frontend but differ in the backend implementation.  
Switch to the branch you prefer to work with depending on the backend technology.
